    <h1>S'mores Recipe</h1>

    <p>Everyone loves spending sometime around the campfire. Even when you dont actively go out of your way to trail into
        the wilderness every now and then, I am sure you may find yourself at a bonfire or two. Well this recipe is sure to 
        help increase the amount of fun spent in front of an open flame (safely of course). S'mores are a tasty sweet treat that
        provides so much fun to make, with very little hassle. Don't worry if you live in an apartment style home either. You can 
        still have this decilious snack with only having to use the stove top, which means - no pans!
